    Calculates the bearing between two points.

    The formulae used is the following:

      - `pointA: The tuple representing the latitude/longitude for the
        first point. Latitude and longitude must be in decimal degrees

        second point. Latitude and longitude must be in decimal degrees

    :Returns:
